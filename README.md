Super Fowl Fists is a local co-op action game where players can challenge alone or together to take down bosses. The game takes on a bright, fun, and comedic style, bringing in 2 satisfying to control characters: Tike Myson and Chicken. Characters are able to fight in 2 forms, using the chibi form for larger attack range and higher mobility, or switch to the buffed form for bigger damage at the cost of reduced attack range and bigger exposure to danger.
